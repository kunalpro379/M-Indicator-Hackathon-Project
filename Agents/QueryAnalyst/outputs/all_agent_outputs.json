In India, one recent case in Pune involved three users who lost a combined ₹ 2.15 lakh after calling a helpline number displayed at an ATM kiosk — which turned out to be fraudulent. ( Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has repeatedly warned that it never makes unsolicited calls to individuals asking for banking or card details.

          "content": "MUMBAI (May 28, 2025) —  A new report from BioCatch which prevents financial crime by recognizing patterns in human behavior, shows its Indian customers reported three times more fraud cases in 2024 than they did in 2023. This follows the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) December announcement that fraud losses in the first half of this Indian fiscal year (April 1-March 31) grew by a factor of eight to Rs 21,367 crore or $2.56 billion, from the same period the year before. That would put India on pace to lose more to fraud in 2024/2025 (Rs 43,571 crore or $5.22 billion) than in any fiscal year since 2021/2022. [...] “Only 48% of fraud cases reported to the RBI between April and September of 2024 occurred during the same fiscal year,” BioCatch Director of Global Fraud Intelligence Tom Peacock said. “Those cases that did take place during this fiscal year represent just 5% of the year’s total losses. So, while that 715% increase in reported fraud losses in the first half of this fiscal year might appear to suggest a massive uptick in fraud in India, reporting delays mean we likely won’t know the true scale of India’s present fraud problem for several years.”\n\nThe report, 2025 Digital Banking Fraud Trends in India, includes deep dives on both Know Your Customer (KYC) scams enabled by recent regulatory changes, and the more than 100,000 digital arrest scams reported in India last year. [...] Other key report findings:\n\n Reporting still lags: Nearly 90% of all fraud cases reported to RBI took place in previous fiscal years.\n Digital arrest scams rampant: The most prevalent scam type in India, digital arrest scams resulted in Rs 2,000 crore ($240 million) in estimated losses, with more than 40% of these scams originating in Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos.\n Eyes on mules: Indian banks are increasingly focused on identifying mule accounts. This is made more complicated by an RBI rule requiring financial institutions in the country to receive a court order before taking action against a suspected mule account.\n\nClick here to view the complete report.\n\n###\n\nAbout BioCatch:",

The complainant has reported receiving suspicious SMS and calls, which is a common tactic used by scammers to trick victims into revealing sensitive information. The grievance has been identified as a critical issue with significant potential consequences, including damage to the company's reputation and financial losses. The urgency level is high due to the immediate impact on the employees and the potential for further escalation. The grievance affects a large number of people (over 100) and has significant potential consequences, including damage to the company's reputation and financial losses. The responsible department is the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), and the supporting departments are the State Bank of India (SBI) and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). The need for immediate action includes verifying the user's location, requesting more specific details about the issue, and taking steps to prevent and report internet banking related fraud. Short-term corrective measures include informing the complainant to regularise the EMI and clear dues, while long-term measures involve implementing robust security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. The citizen's frustration and trust erosion are evident in the grievance, highlighting the need for prompt and effective resolution.",

MAIN TITLE\n   - First line must be exactly:\n     # Government Grievance Assessment Report\n\n2. SECTION HEADING: \"Case Identification\"\n   - Use the heading:\n     ## Case Identification\n   - Immediately below it, write ONE compact, factual paragraph that officially identifies\n     the case, similar to the opening of a government file note. This paragraph must\n     naturally include:\n       * Grievance ID (a unique reference like G-YYYYMMDD-XXXX),\n       * Date of submission (if not explicitly available, reasonably infer or state it\n         in a neutral way such as \"on or around [month, year]\"),\n       * Nature of grievance (Complaint / Request / Appeal / Query etc.),\n       * Category & Subcategory,\n       * Reported or assessed priority (High / Medium / Low).\n     - This paragraph should be purely factual, with NO emotional language or analysis.\n\n3. SECTION HEADING: \"Detailed Assessment and Case Study\"\n   - Use the heading:\n     ## Detailed Assessment and Case Study\n   - Under this heading, write ONE single long paragraph. Do NOT use sub-headings,\n     bullet lists, or labelled sections (e.g. \"Context & Background\", \"Evidence &\n     Proof Analysis\", \"Historical Grievance Analysis\"). Weave everything into one\n     continuous flowing narrative that covers: where the problem is (city, ward,\n     locality) and since when; how it affects public life (health, environment,\n     daily routine); the core problem (solid waste, open dumping, odour, pests,\n     health hazards, civic violations); available evidence and whether it points to\n     systemic failure; how similar past grievances were handled and any recurring\n     pattern; whether this fits a broader trend of delayed or incomplete resolution;\n     citizen frustration, neglect, trust erosion; why the priority level is\n     High/Medium/Low (health risk, scale, escalation potential); responsible\n     department and supporting departments; and the need for immediate action plus\n     short- and long-term corrective measures. The reader should feel \"this case\n     requires action\" without seeing any sub-headings or section labels.\n\n\nADDITIONAL FORMAT RULES:\n- Do NOT create any extra headings apart from:\n  \"# Government Grievance Assessment Report\",\n  \"## Case Identification\",\n  \"## Detailed Assessment and Case Study\".\n- Do NOT mention internal AI details such as \"agents\", \"models\", \"tools\",\n  \"pipelines\", \"prompts\", \"APIs\", \"API keys\", or technical error messages\n  (for example, image-analysis failures or permission errors). If some\n  evidence is unavailable, simply note that the available material is\n  limited or incomplete, without describing technical reasons.\n- Do NOT provide specific phone numbers, email IDs, or named grievance\n  cells; where necessary, refer only to generic channels such as \"the\n  municipal grievance portal\", \"the ward office\", or \"the competent\n  authority\".\n- Do NOT output JSON, error messages, or meta comments like \"Thought:\" or\n  \"Final Answer\".\n- Output ONLY the final public document in plain Markdown.\n\nReturn plain Markdown, no JSON.\n"
