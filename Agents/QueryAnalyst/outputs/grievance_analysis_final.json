People here prefer to pay and move on. Time is money,” the officer said.\n\nRetired ACB officials pointed to procedural barriers that discourage complainants. Laying a trap requires verification of the complaint, coordination with government panch witnesses and strict documentation. In large agencies such as MHADA, MMRDA and sections of the BMC, entry protocols and visitor logs make covert operations more difficult.",

            "content": "MUMBAI (May 28, 2025) —  A new report from BioCatch which prevents financial crime by recognizing patterns in human behavior, shows its Indian customers reported three times more fraud cases in 2024 than they did in 2023. This follows the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) December announcement that fraud losses in the first half of this Indian fiscal year (April 1-March 31) grew by a factor of eight to Rs 21,367 crore or $2.56 billion, from the same period the year before. That would put India on pace to lose more to fraud in 2024/2025 (Rs 43,571 crore or $5.22 billion) than in any fiscal year since 2021/2022. [...] “Only 48% of fraud cases reported to the RBI between April and September of 2024 occurred during the same fiscal year,” BioCatch Director of Global Fraud Intelligence Tom Peacock said. “Those cases that did take place during this fiscal year represent just 5% of the year’s total losses. So, while that 715% increase in reported fraud losses in the first half of this fiscal year might appear to suggest a massive uptick in fraud in India, reporting delays mean we likely won’t know the true scale of India’s present fraud problem for several years.”\n\nThe report, 2025 Digital Banking Fraud Trends in India, includes deep dives on both Know Your Customer (KYC) scams enabled by recent regulatory changes, and the more than 100,000 digital arrest scams reported in India last year. [...] Other key report findings:\n\n Reporting still lags: Nearly 90% of all fraud cases reported to RBI took place in previous fiscal years.\n Digital arrest scams rampant: The most prevalent scam type in India, digital arrest scams resulted in Rs 2,000 crore ($240 million) in estimated losses, with more than 40% of these scams originating in Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos.\n Eyes on mules: Indian banks are increasingly focused on identifying mule accounts. This is made more complicated by an RBI rule requiring financial institutions in the country to receive a court order before taking action against a suspected mule account.\n\nClick here to view the complete report.\n\n###\n\nAbout BioCatch:",
